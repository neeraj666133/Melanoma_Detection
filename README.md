# Melanoma Detection Using CNN
> Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer-related deaths. This project aims to build a CNN-based model that can accurately detect melanoma from dermoscopic images. The goal is to assist dermatologists by reducing the manual effort involved in diagnosis, improving early detection, and potentially saving lives.

## General Information
- This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect melanoma using dermoscopic images.
- The primary objective is to automate the detection of melanoma to aid dermatologists in early diagnosis and potentially reduce the manual workload involved in analyzing skin cancer images.
- Melanoma is responsible for a significant number of skin cancer deaths, and early detection is critical to improving patient outcomes.
- The dataset used is sourced from the [International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)](https://isic-archive.com/), containing 2,357 dermoscopic images classified as benign or malignant.

## Conclusions
- The CNN model has shown promising results in distinguishing between benign and malignant skin conditions from dermoscopic images.
- Early and accurate melanoma detection using this model can potentially save lives by allowing faster intervention and diagnosis.
- The model's accuracy, recall, and precision can be further improved with more training data and fine-tuning of hyperparameters.
- This model can be deployed as a tool to assist dermatologists by providing a second opinion or flagging suspicious skin conditions.
